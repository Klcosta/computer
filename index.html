                The motherboard is the base for your computer where all other hardware
                components are attached. You should generally choose your motherboard as one of the first
                things when building a computer. It may have limited compatibility with certain other types of
                computer hardware. Your choice in motherboard may be limited by your chassis as
                motherboards vary in size.

                    The amount of random-access memory (RAM) a computer has, together with
                    the CPU, is the main factor in the computer's processing power. Utilized for processing and
                    temporarily stores data for ease of access, providing a better and faster user experience.

                    The central processing unit (CPU) acts as the “Brain” of the computer, being
                    one of the most essential pieces of hardware for building your computer. It communicates with
                    and controls all the other hardware connected to the motherboard, and helps with processing
                    tasks.

                    is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display device (such as a computer monitor). Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics. At the core of both is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the main part that does the actual computations, but should not be confused with the video card as a whole, although "GPU" is often used to refer to video cards.

                    The power supply unit (PSU) is the main source of power for all components in
                    the computer. Make sure you pick the right one with regards to the estimated power

                    <br><br>
                    The general storage device for the computer for all data and apps. There are 3
                    types:
                    The Hard Disk Drive(HDD) is most commonly used in old setups. The core feature of the
                    HDD is cheap storage capacity. It’s considerably slower, so using it as the main drive for your
                    device is generally not recommended in this day and age.
                    The Solid State Drive(SSD) which generally does the same as the HDD but accesses the data
                    faster. Due to the technology being more modern, the price of the SSD is generally
                    considerably larger.
                    The Solid State Hybrid Drive (SSHD), which is a fusion between the two. The initial idea
                    behind the SSHD was to get the storage capacity of the HDD and the speed of the SSD. Since
                    then the storage capacity of the average SSD has become much larger, which subsequently
                    made the SSHDs less relevant.

                    The hardware ensuring that the computer doesn’t overheat, mainly used to cool
                    the CPU as it is the main heat source, sometimes the GPU if it is lacking its own cooling
                    components.
